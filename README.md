This is my snake game 
This project involves creating a classic Snake game using the Pygame library in Python. The game allows players to control a snake, navigate it around the screen, and consume food to grow in length. The objective is to avoid colliding with the screen boundaries or the snake's own body. The game provides a simple yet engaging experience, challenging players to achieve the highest possible score by growing the snake as long as possible.
